                    Comprehensive Provincial Summary: Prince Edward Island üá®üá¶
                </h1>

                <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    <h2>1. Geography and Physical Landscape</h2>
                    <p>Prince Edward Island is Canada‚Äôs smallest province, both in size and population. It is located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and is connected to the mainland (New Brunswick) by the Confederation Bridge, which spans nearly 13 kilometres.</p>
                    <p>PEI is known for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rolling green hills and red-soil farmland</li>
                        <li>Rugged coastal cliffs and beaches</li>
                        <li>Gentle rivers and bays</li>
                        <li>Picturesque fishing villages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Its red soil, rich in iron oxide, supports productive agriculture and forms a distinct part of the province‚Äôs character. The surrounding waters offer some of the best fishing grounds in Canada.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>2. Indigenous Roots and Early Peoples</h2>
                    <p>Before European settlement, PEI was inhabited by the Mi‚Äôkmaq people, who called the island Epekwitk, meaning ‚Äúlying in the water.‚Äù They lived in harmony with the land and sea, harvesting fish and shellfish, navigating by canoe, and maintaining seasonal camps.</p>
                    <p>The Mi‚Äôkmaq continue to live on PEI and contribute actively to the cultural and political life of the province.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>3. French and British Settlement</h2>
                    <p>In the 1700s, French settlers established communities and called the island √éle Saint-Jean. As part of Acadia, it was home to many Acadian families.</p>
                    <p>After the British gained control of the region in the mid-1700s, Acadians were deported in a tragic episode known as Le Grand D√©rangement. Some Acadians returned later, and their descendants remain in parts of the province today.</p>
                    <p>The British later renamed the island Prince Edward Island, in honour of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>4. Confederation and Nation-Building</h2>
                    <p>Although PEI hosted the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, which helped spark the idea of a united Canada, the province initially refused to join Confederation in 1867.</p>
                    <p>PEI finally joined Canada on July 1, 1873, after the federal government agreed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assume the colony‚Äôs railway debts</li>
                        <li>Provide ferry services to the mainland</li>
                        <li>Secure land ownership reforms (many settlers were renting from absentee landlords)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Today, PEI proudly claims the title ‚ÄúBirthplace of Confederation‚Äù, with Charlottetown recognized as the city where Canada‚Äôs foundation was planned.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>5. Population and Communities</h2>
                    <p>PEI has a population of just under 175,000 people, making it Canada‚Äôs smallest by number. It has a rural character, with many people living in small towns or countryside settings.</p>
                    <p>Key cities include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Charlottetown ‚Äì The capital and largest city, site of historic events and home to government and commerce.</li>
                        <li>Summerside ‚Äì The second-largest city, with a strong focus on business, culture, and the military (home to CFB Summerside).</li>

                    <p>Political life on PEI is often local and personal ‚Äî given the small population, residents tend to know their elected officials and participate actively in civic life.</p>
                    <br>
