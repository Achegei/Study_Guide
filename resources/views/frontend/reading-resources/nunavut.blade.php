                    <h2>Chapter 1: Rights & Responsibilities of Citizenship</h2>
                    <p>Canadian citizens enjoy fundamental rightsâ€”including freedom of speech, mobility, religion, and equality. Equally important are civic duties: obeying the law, voting, serving on a jury, and caring for the environment. In Nunavut, these responsibilities also reflect traditional values like respect for elders, community cooperation, and stewardship of the land.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 2: Who We Are â€“ Canadaâ€™s Identity</h2>
                    <p>Canada is a multicultural nation built on relationships among Indigenous peoples, descendants of French and British settlers, and newcomers worldwide. Nunavut is unique: over 85% of its population is Inuit, and Inuktitut is widely spoken alongside English and French. Inuit cultureâ€”particularly storytelling, community values, seasonal knowledge, and respect for the landâ€”is central to the territoryâ€™s identity.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 3: Canadaâ€™s History</h2>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples have lived across Canada for millennia. In Nunavut, the Inuit developed sophisticated ways to navigate sea ice, whalesâ€™ migratory patterns, and the Arcticâ€™s climate. European contact came laterâ€”fur traders in the 18th century, followed by northern exploration. Nunavut was officially established on <strong>April 1, 1999</strong>, following the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, making it Canadaâ€™s newest territory and affirming Inuit rights and self-governance.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 4: Modern Canada</h2>
                    <p>Canada today is known for peace, diversity, robust democracy, and respect for human rights. Nunavut operates under a blended governance system integrating <strong>Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit</strong> (traditional knowledge) and parliamentary practices. Public services are largely government-led, focusing on social welfare, education, housing, and infrastructureâ€”key priorities in remote and northern communities.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 5: How Canadians Govern Themselves</h2>
                    <p>Canada is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The monarch is Canadaâ€™s head of state, represented nationally by the Governor General, and in Nunavut by the Commissioner (appointed federally). Nunavut uses a <strong>consensus-style legislature</strong>, where elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) select the Premier and cabinet. This system ensures inclusive decision-making and reflects Inuit values of cooperation and respect.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 6: Federal Elections</h2>
                    <p>Citizens aged 18 or older may vote in federal elections. Nunavut forms a single electoral district, which elects one Member of Parliament to represent the territory in Ottawa. Campaigns often address issues relevant to the North: transportation, communications, high cost of living, housing, and Indigenous education.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 7: The Justice System</h2>
                    <p>Canadaâ€™s justice system is based on English common law, with influences from French civil law. Everyone is equal before the law and has rights to fair treatment, legal representation, and a jury trial. In Nunavut, community justice approachesâ€”including sentencing circles and restorative practicesâ€”complement formal courts to reflect Inuit cultural values.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 8: Canadian Symbols</h2>
                    <p>Canada is symbolized by its flag (maple leaf), national anthem, and motto. Nunavut adds its own symbols: the territoryâ€™s flag, featuring a red <strong>inuksuk</strong> and <strong>North Star</strong>, and the territorial coat of arms with an inuksuk atop a qulliq (traditional Inuit oil lamp). These icons celebrate identity, history, and the Arctic landscape.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 9: Canadaâ€™s Economy</h2>
                    <p>Canadaâ€™s diverse economy includes natural resources, manufacturing, technology, and services. Nunavutâ€™s economy relies on public sector jobs, local businesses, mining (gold, diamonds), arts and crafts, fishing, and traditional harvesting. Thereâ€™s growing investment in local training, tourism, and renewable energy to build self-reliance.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 10: Canadaâ€™s Regions</h2>
                    <p>Canada is divided into six regions. Nunavut forms part of the Northern Region, which includes the Arctic. It is Canadaâ€™s largest territory by area but has many remote, fly-in-only communities. Important geographic facts: tundra terrain, numerous islands, permafrost, and wildlife like Arctic char, caribou, polar bears, and seals. <strong>Iqaluit</strong> is the capital and center of government and administration.</p>
                    <br>
