                    <h2>Chapter 1: Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship</h2>
                    <p>In Canada, all citizens are protected by a set of legal and constitutional rights‚Äîfreedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly, and mobility among them. But with rights come responsibilities: voting in elections, obeying the law, respecting others, and contributing to the community. In Ontario, exercising these responsibilities includes staying informed on political issues, helping newcomers feel welcome, and participating in community service or volunteering.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 2: Who We Are ‚Äì Canadian Identity and Diversity</h2>
                    <p>Canada is a nation built by Indigenous peoples, French and British settlers, and immigrants from around the world. <strong>Ontario is a true reflection of this diversity</strong>‚Äîit‚Äôs home to over 14 million people, with significant communities from South Asia, China, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. It is a province where cultural heritage is celebrated, with multicultural festivals, languages, and foods coexisting side-by-side.</p>
                    <p><strong>Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is often referred to as the most multicultural city in the world.</strong> It represents modern Canadian values: tolerance, diversity, and inclusion.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 3: Canada‚Äôs History</h2>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples‚ÄîFirst Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit‚Äîhave lived across Canada for thousands of years. In what is now Ontario, Indigenous societies built trade networks, governance systems, and vibrant cultures. The French and British arrived in the 1600s, and Ontario played a major role in the fur trade, settlement, and battles between colonial powers.</p>
                    <p>After Canada became a country in 1867, <strong>Ontario was one of the original four provinces.</strong> It became the center of political and economic life in English-speaking Canada, with growing industries and a rising population of immigrants who helped build cities, railways, and the economy.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 4: Modern Canada</h2>
                    <p>Today, Canada is a democratic, peaceful, and globally respected country. Ontario leads in many areas of modern life: finance, education, manufacturing, and innovation. Cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Waterloo are hubs of technology and research. Ontario universities attract international students, and the province plays a strong role in federal politics, economic development, and national unity.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 5: How Canadians Govern Themselves</h2>
                    <p>Canada is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. The monarch is the head of state, represented by the Governor General. Citizens elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. At the provincial level, Ontario has its own elected legislature at <strong>Queen‚Äôs Park in Toronto</strong>. The head of Ontario‚Äôs government is the <strong>Premier</strong>, and provincial laws are passed by the Legislative Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Municipalities (cities and towns) also have mayors and councils who manage local services like waste collection, transit, and parks.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 6: Federal Elections</h2>
                    <p>Every Canadian citizen aged 18 and older has the right to vote in federal elections. <strong>Ontario has the highest number of federal electoral districts</strong>, meaning many MPs represent Ontario in Ottawa. During elections, political parties campaign across the province, and voters cast a ballot for their preferred local candidate.</p>
                    <p>It‚Äôs every citizen‚Äôs duty to vote, understand party platforms, and contribute to fair and peaceful elections.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 7: The Justice System</h2>
                    <p>Canada‚Äôs legal system is grounded in English common law and the French civil code. In Ontario, courts operate under common law principles, and citizens have the right to a fair trial and to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>
                    <p>Police in Ontario include the <strong>Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)</strong>, municipal forces, and special enforcement units. Everyone is expected to respect the law and participate in the justice system when needed‚Äîwhether as a witness, jury member, or law-abiding citizen.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 8: Canadian Symbols</h2>
                    <p>National symbols such as the Canadian flag, maple leaf, national anthem (‚ÄúO Canada‚Äù), and beaver are cherished across the country. In Ontario, the provincial flower is the <strong>white trillium</strong>. The province‚Äôs coat of arms includes a moose, deer, and black bear, representing its rich natural environment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, and Parliament Hill in Ottawa</strong> (Canada‚Äôs capital, located in Ontario) are also widely recognized symbols of the province and nation.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 9: Canada‚Äôs Economy</h2>
                    <p>Canada has a strong and diverse economy, and Ontario plays a central role. It is <strong>Canada‚Äôs manufacturing engine</strong>, producing cars, aircraft parts, machinery, and technology. The service sector‚Äîincluding finance, education, healthcare, and real estate‚Äîis Ontario‚Äôs largest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Toronto is the financial capital of the country</strong>, home to the Toronto Stock Exchange and major banks. Agriculture and mining also contribute, especially in rural and northern areas of Ontario.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 10: Canada‚Äôs Regions</h2>
                    <p>Canada is divided into six geographic regions. Ontario lies in the <strong>Central Region</strong>, between Quebec and Manitoba. It borders the Great Lakes and shares a long boundary with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Ontario has both large urban centers and vast rural areas. It includes the capital of Canada (Ottawa), as well as Toronto (the provincial capital). Its population is the highest of all provinces, making it politically influential and economically powerful.</p>
                    <br>
