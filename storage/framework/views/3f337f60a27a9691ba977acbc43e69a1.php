                        <li>Located in Western Canada, Alberta is one of the three Prairie provinces, bordered by British Columbia (west), Saskatchewan (east), Northwest Territories (north), and Montana (south). Its land spans from the Great Plains in the east to the Rockies in the west, covering about 661,848 km¬≤, making it the fourth largest province Ôøº Ôøº.</li>
                        <li>Northern areas consist of boreal forest and subarctic climate, while the south supports semi-arid grassland. The province experiences extreme temperature swings, with Chinook winds bringing rapid warming in winter Ôøº.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. History of Settlement</h2>

                        <li>From the early-to-mid 1700s, French fur traders (Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, North West Company) and explorers like Anthony Henday and Alexander Mackenzie pushed westward and northward, engaging with First Nations and M√©tis communities Ôøº.</li>
                        <li>The North-West Mounted Police (Mounties) arrived in 1874 to establish law and order. Settlement surged after the Canadian Pacific Railway reached Calgary in the 1880s. Alberta officially joined Confederation as a province on September 1, 1905, named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta Ôøº.</li>
