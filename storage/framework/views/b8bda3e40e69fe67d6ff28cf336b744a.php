                    <h2>1. Geography and Natural Environment</h2>
                    <p>Saskatchewan is located in the heart of the Canadian Prairies. It‚Äôs the only province with all its borders being landlocked, surrounded by Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, and U.S. states like Montana and North Dakota. The landscape is marked by wide-open plains, fertile farmlands, and more than 100,000 lakes and rivers‚Äîmaking it a key contributor to Canada‚Äôs freshwater supply.</p>
                    <p>The south features flat, open farmland, while the north is rich in forests, rivers, and mineral deposits. Saskatchewan is known for its long summer days and cold, dry winters. The prairie sky is iconic‚Äîoften stretching uninterrupted from horizon to horizon.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>2. Indigenous Peoples and Early Settlement</h2>
                    <p>Before European contact, Indigenous peoples such as the Cree, Dene, Saulteaux, Dakota, and Nakota lived across the territory. They hunted bison, fished the rivers, and practiced sustainable life on the prairies and in the boreal forests.</p>
                    <p>The M√©tis people‚Äîdescendants of First Nations and European fur traders‚Äîalso shaped the cultural landscape, especially around areas like Batoche and Duck Lake.</p>
                    <p>The fur trade arrived in the 1700s through companies like the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company and the North West Company. Trading forts became central hubs for early contact, cultural exchange, and economic activity.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>3. Joining Confederation</h2>
                    <p>Saskatchewan became a province of Canada on September 1, 1905, carved from the Northwest Territories. Its formation was part of the western expansion led by the federal government under Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier.</p>
                    <p>The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway played a central role in its development, encouraging immigration and allowing goods and settlers to reach prairie towns and farms.</p>
                    <p>The population rapidly expanded in the early 1900s due to immigration from Europe, particularly Ukraine, Germany, Poland, and Scandinavia. These settlers brought distinct cultures and traditions that continue to influence Saskatchewan today.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>4. Saskatchewan‚Äôs Economy</h2>
                    <p>Saskatchewan‚Äôs economy is heavily based on natural resources and agriculture:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agriculture: The province is a global leader in wheat, barley, canola, lentils, and flax production. It‚Äôs often called ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs breadbasket.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>Mining: It holds some of the world‚Äôs largest potash reserves and is a major source of uranium.</li>
                        <li>Oil and Gas: Southern Saskatchewan contributes significantly to Canada‚Äôs energy sector.</li>
                        <li>Forestry: The north supplies timber and wood products.</li>
                        <li>Innovation: Saskatoon is a hub for agricultural biotechnology and scientific research.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Though the economy remains rooted in primary industries, education, health care, technology, and trade have become increasingly important.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>5. Demographics and Society</h2>

                    <h2>8. Indigenous Reconciliation in Saskatchewan</h2>

                    <h2>9. Immigration and Multiculturalism</h2>
