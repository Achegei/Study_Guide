                    <h2>1. Location and Geography</h2>
                    <p>Yukon is one of Canada‚Äôs three northern territories, located in the northwest corner of the country. It shares borders with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>British Columbia to the south</li>
                        <li>Northwest Territories to the east</li>
                        <li>U.S. state of Alaska to the west</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is Canada‚Äôs smallest territory by population but vast in size, featuring:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Towering mountains, including Mount Logan ‚Äî the highest peak in Canada</li>
                        <li>The Yukon River, which flows over 3,000 km through Alaska to the Bering Sea</li>
                        <li>Tundra, boreal forest, and alpine landscapes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The climate varies dramatically: extremely cold winters, brief but intense summers, and long daylight hours in summer months, including the ‚Äúmidnight sun.‚Äù</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>2. Indigenous Peoples and Ancient Presence</h2>
                    <p>Yukon has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years. These First Nations developed complex cultures, languages, and relationships with the land.</p>
                    <p>Key Indigenous nations in Yukon include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tr‚Äôond√´k Hw√´ch‚Äôin</li>
                        <li>Kwanlin D√ºn</li>
                        <li>Vuntut Gwitchin</li>
                        <li>Tlingit</li>
                        <li>Northern Tutchone</li>
                        <li>Southern Tutchone</li>
                        <li>Tagish</li>
                        <li>Gwich‚Äôin</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Traditional knowledge, stories, and land-based practices continue to guide life in the territory. Indigenous peoples remain leaders in self-government, conservation, and education.</p>
                    <p>Over 70% of Yukon First Nations have signed modern land claim agreements, giving them control over land use, education, and resource management.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>3. European Contact and the Klondike Gold Rush</h2>
                    <p>Yukon remained relatively untouched by Europeans until the late 1800s. In 1896, gold was discovered near the Klondike River, sparking the Klondike Gold Rush.</p>
                    <p>Within two years:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tens of thousands of prospectors flooded into Dawson City</li>
                        <li>Yukon was carved out of the Northwest Territories and officially became a territory in 1898</li>
                        <li>Boomtowns emerged, including Dawson and Whitehorse</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The gold rush transformed the landscape, economy, and Indigenous way of life. While most prospectors left empty-handed, the event left a lasting cultural imprint.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>4. Territorial Governance and Political Evolution</h2>
                    <p>Yukon is not a province, but it has a unique territorial government that functions similarly. Its governance includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Commissioner, appointed federally, representing Canada</li>
                        <li>A Premier, elected locally, leading the Yukon government</li>
                        <li>A Legislative Assembly, responsible for passing laws</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Over time, Yukon has gained increasing political autonomy. Since the 1970s, decision-making power has shifted from federal authorities to local governments.</p>
                    <p>Today, Yukon governs many of its own affairs, including health, education, and environmental management.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>5. Cities, Communities, and Population</h2>
                    <p>Yukon‚Äôs population is just over 44,000 people (as of 2025), concentrated mainly in:</p>
                    <p><strong>Whitehorse</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capital and largest city</li>
                        <li>Home to about 75% of Yukoners</li>
                        <li>Administrative, cultural, and commercial hub</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Dawson City</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Historic gold rush town turned heritage and tourism centre</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Smaller Communities</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Old Crow (only fly-in community)</li>
                        <li>Teslin, Haines Junction, Watson Lake, and others</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Yukon communities are often tight-knit and shaped by Indigenous cultures, seasonal activities, and strong environmental awareness.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>6. Economy and Industry</h2>
                    <p>Yukon‚Äôs economy is based on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mining: Gold, silver, copper, and zinc remain major exports</li>
                        <li>Tourism: Heritage sites, wildlife, and northern lights draw global visitors</li>
                        <li>Public service: Government is a major employer</li>
                        <li>Small business and arts: Yukon has a thriving arts community</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In recent years, Yukon has focused on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar)</li>
                        <li>Cultural tourism</li>
                        <li>Indigenous economic partnerships</li>
                        <li>Sustainable land and wildlife management</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h2>7. Indigenous Self-Government and Land Claims</h2>
                    <p>Yukon is a national leader in Indigenous self-governance.</p>
                    <p>Starting in the 1970s, Yukon First Nations negotiated agreements that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gave them legal ownership of settlement lands</li>
                        <li>Created modern governments with law-making powers</li>
                        <li>Protected cultural rights, language, and education</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As of 2025, 11 of Yukon‚Äôs 14 First Nations have signed Self-Government Agreements, representing over half of all such agreements in Canada.</p>
                    <p>These nations run:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Their own school systems and curricula</li>
                        <li>Justice and health programs</li>
                        <li>Environmental co-management boards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h2>8. Culture, Arts, and Traditions</h2>
                    <p>Yukon‚Äôs culture blends:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Nations heritage: drumming, storytelling, beading, dancing</li>
                        <li>Gold rush history: re-enactments, saloons, historic buildings</li>
                        <li>Northern survival and community pride</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Festivals and events include:</p>

                        <li>Great Northern Arts Festival</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Yukon Arts Centre in Whitehorse showcases performances, visual art, and cultural education.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>9. Education and Services</h2>
                    <p>Yukon offers English-language education and increasing Indigenous language inclusion. French-language schools are also available for the territory‚Äôs small francophone population.</p>
                    <p>Key institutions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Yukon University</strong> ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs first university north of 60¬∞, focusing on Indigenous governance, climate science, and trades</li>
                        <li>Public schools integrating First Nations history and land-based learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Healthcare and public services are primarily delivered by the territorial government and supplemented by community-led organizations.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>10. Language and Diversity</h2>
                    <p>English is the main language, but Yukon is linguistically rich:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Indigenous languages include Gwich‚Äôin, Tlingit, Southern Tutchone, and others</li>
                        <li>French is spoken by a small but vibrant community, with French services and schooling</li>
                        <li>Immigration is bringing new linguistic and cultural diversity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Newcomers often settle in Whitehorse and bring contributions to business, education, and healthcare.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>11. Immigration and Modern Growth</h2>
                    <p>Though remote, Yukon actively encourages immigration through:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Settlement services for newcomers and refugees</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Yukon‚Äôs approach to diversity emphasizes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Respect for Indigenous culture</li>
                        <li>Community integration</li>
                        <li>Support for family and business development</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Population growth has led to greater infrastructure investment in housing, transport, and public health.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>12. Environment and Climate Stewardship</h2>
                    <p>Yukon is at the front line of climate change, with:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Forest fires</li>
                        <li>Glacial melt</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The territory promotes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Renewable energy development</li>
                        <li>Conservation of parks and protected areas</li>
                        <li>Indigenous co-management of wildlife</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Yukoners have a deep respect for nature ‚Äî hiking, fishing, snowmobiling, and canoeing are part of everyday life.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>13. Symbols and Territorial Identity</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flag:</strong> Green (forests), white (snow), and blue (rivers) with the Yukon coat of arms</li>
                        <li><strong>Coat of Arms:</strong> Husky dog, cross of St. George, and wavy lines representing rivers</li>
