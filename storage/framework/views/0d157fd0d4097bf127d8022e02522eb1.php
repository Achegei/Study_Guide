                    <h2>Chapter 1 – Canada and Citizenship</h2>
                    <h3>1.1 Understanding Canadian Citizenship</h3>
                    <p>Canadian citizenship is both a legal status and a shared national identity. It signifies belonging to a country built on freedom, democracy, equality, and the rule of law.</p>
                    <p>As a citizen, you gain rights and freedoms that allow you to live with dignity and opportunity — but you also take on responsibilities that sustain Canada’s fairness, stability, and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>It’s a two-way relationship:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Canada offers protection, opportunity, and a secure society.</li>
                        <li>In return, you respect its laws, values, and traditions, and contribute to the community.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Citizenship also connects you to the sacrifices and achievements of past generations, while committing you to leaving a better Canada for those who follow.</p>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Canada is both a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong> (the King is the Head of State) and a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> (citizens elect representatives to govern).</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.2 How Canadian Citizenship Evolved</h3>
                    <p>Before 1947, people living in Canada were legally British subjects. Over time, Canada’s identity developed into an independent nationality.</p>
                    <p>Key milestones:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1947 – Canadian Citizenship Act:</strong> Established Canadian citizenship as distinct from British nationality.</li>
                        <li><strong>1977 – Law Reform:</strong> Allowed dual citizenship and removed rules that caused loss of citizenship for Canadians living abroad or marrying non-Canadians.</li>
                        <li><strong>Today:</strong> Citizenship is granted by birth in Canada, by birth abroad to Canadian parents, or by naturalization for eligible permanent residents.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.3 Rights of Canadian Citizens</h3>
                    <p>Canadian citizens enjoy specific rights not available to permanent or temporary residents.</p>
                    <p>Core rights include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Vote in Elections</strong> – Federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Run for Public Office</strong> – Become a candidate in elections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hold a Canadian Passport</strong> – Provides visa-free access to many countries and diplomatic support abroad.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equality Before the Law</strong> – Protection from discrimination and equal treatment under Canadian law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Language Rights</strong> – Access to federal services in English or French, anywhere in Canada.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>📌 Test Tip: <strong>Only citizens can vote in federal elections.</strong> Permanent residents cannot.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.4 Responsibilities of Canadian Citizens</h3>
                    <p>With citizenship comes the duty to uphold Canada’s values and maintain its stability.</p>
                    <p>Core responsibilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Obey the Law</strong> – Applies equally to everyone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serve on a Jury</strong> – Ensures fairness in court trials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vote</strong> – Keeps democracy strong.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect the Environment</strong> – Preserve natural resources for future generations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defend Canada</strong> – Contribute to national protection when required.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.5 The Oath of Citizenship</h3>
                    <p>The final step in becoming a citizen is taking the Oath of Citizenship during a public ceremony. In the oath, you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Swear loyalty to His Majesty King Charles III, King of Canada.</li>
                        <li>Promise to respect Canada’s laws.</li>
                        <li>Commit to the responsibilities of citizenship.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is both a legal requirement and a symbolic commitment to the Canadian family.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.6 Canadian Values</h3>
                    <p>Canada’s identity is shaped by shared values:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Freedom</strong> – Live and express yourself without fear, within the law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Democracy</strong> – Leaders chosen in fair, free, and regular elections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equality</strong> – Equal treatment for all, regardless of background.</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Rights</strong> – Protection from discrimination and injustice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiculturalism</strong> – Embracing diversity as a strength.</li>
                        <li><strong>Peaceful Coexistence</strong> – Resolving disagreements without violence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.7 Pathways to Citizenship</h3>
                    <p>Most newcomers become citizens through naturalization:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Become a permanent resident.</li>
                        <li>Live in Canada for at least 1,095 days in the past 5 years.</li>
                        <li>Demonstrate basic English or French ability.</li>
                        <li>Pass the citizenship test.</li>
                        <li>Have no serious criminal record.</li>
                        <li>Attend the citizenship ceremony and take the oath.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Others are citizens automatically by birth — either in Canada or abroad to Canadian parents.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.8 Why Citizenship Matters</h3>
                    <p>Canadian citizenship provides:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A voice in shaping Canada’s future through voting.</li>
                        <li>Access to certain careers (e.g., government jobs with security clearance).</li>
                        <li>Stronger travel rights and protections abroad.</li>
                        <li>A lifelong bond to Canada’s people, land, and values.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Chapter 2 – Canadian History: From Indigenous Roots to Confederation</h2>
                    <h3>2.1 Canada Before European Contact</h3>
                    <p>Long before Canada existed as a country, the land was home to diverse Indigenous peoples with their own languages, governance systems, spiritual beliefs, and cultural traditions. Archaeological evidence shows they have lived here for thousands of years, adapting to Canada’s varied climates and landscapes.</p>
                    <p>Main Indigenous groups:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First Nations</strong> – The largest and most diverse group, living from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Woodland peoples built longhouses and hunted moose and deer.</li>
                                <li>Plains peoples followed bison herds and lived in portable tipis.</li>
                                <li>West Coast peoples, such as the Haida and Coast Salish, fished, carved totem poles, and built cedar longhouses.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Inuit</strong> – Inhabited the Arctic and subarctic, hunting seals, whales, and fish, and building igloos or sod houses. They mastered survival in extreme cold with specialized clothing and tools.</li>
                        <li><strong>Métis</strong> – A distinct people of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry, emerging during the fur trade. They developed the Michif language and unique cultural traditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Indigenous peoples had sophisticated trade networks long before Europeans arrived.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.2 Early European Exploration</h3>
                    <p>The first known Europeans to reach what is now Canada were the Norse, led by Leif Erikson around the year 1000, who briefly settled at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland.</p>
                    <p>Centuries later, exploration began in earnest:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>John Cabot</strong> (Giovanni Caboto), an Italian sailing for England, explored parts of Newfoundland in 1497.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jacques Cartier</strong>, a French explorer, made three voyages (1534–1542), mapping the Gulf of St. Lawrence and claiming land for France.</li>
                        <li>Cartier recorded the word <strong>kanata</strong> from the Iroquoian people, meaning “village” or “settlement” — the origin of the name “Canada.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.3 The Fur Trade</h3>
                    <p>From the 1600s to the 1800s, the fur trade was Canada’s dominant economic driver:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beaver pelts were prized in Europe for hat-making.</li>
                        <li>Indigenous peoples trapped and prepared the furs, trading them for metal tools, blankets, and firearms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC)</strong> – Founded in 1670 with a royal charter, controlling Rupert’s Land.</li>
                        <li><strong>North West Company</strong> – A Montreal-based rival, more active in the interior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Voyageurs and coureurs de bois</strong> – Traders and paddlers who ventured deep inland to exchange goods with Indigenous communities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: The fur trade influenced settlement patterns and Indigenous-European relations for centuries.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.4 Rivalry Between France and Britain</h3>
                    <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, France and Britain fought for dominance in North America:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>New France</strong> – Settlements along the St. Lawrence River, Quebec City, Montreal, and Acadia.</li>
                        <li>British colonies – In Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and later the Thirteen Colonies to the south.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seven Years’ War</strong> (1756–1763) – Decisive conflict in which the British defeated the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759).</li>
                        <li><strong>Treaty of Paris</strong> (1763) – France ceded most of its North American territories to Britain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quebec Act</strong> (1774) – Protected French language, Catholic religion, and civil law in Quebec.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.5 Loyalists and Early Growth</h3>
                    <p>After the American Revolution (1775–1783), tens of thousands of Loyalists — colonists loyal to Britain — moved north to British North America:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many settled in Nova Scotia, Quebec, and the new colony of New Brunswick (1784).</li>
                        <li>In 1791, the Constitutional Act split Quebec into:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Upper Canada (now Ontario) – English-speaking, English law.</li>
                                <li>Lower Canada (now Quebec) – French-speaking, French civil law.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.6 Steps Toward Confederation</h3>
                    <p>Several events pushed the colonies toward unity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>War of 1812</strong> – Britain and its colonies resisted American invasions, boosting a shared identity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rebellions of 1837–1838</strong> – Calls for more democratic government in Upper and Lower Canada.</li>
                        <li><strong>Act of Union (1841)</strong> – Merged Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsible Government</strong> – Gave colonies more control over internal affairs.</li>
                        <li>Economic Cooperation – Trade and rail links encouraged unity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.7 Confederation – 1867</h3>
                    <p>On <strong>July 1, 1867</strong>, the British North America Act united four provinces into the Dominion of Canada:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ontario</li>
                        <li>Quebec</li>
                        <li>New Brunswick</li>
                        <li>Nova Scotia</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Canada gained control over domestic policy while remaining part of the British Empire. Over time, other provinces and territories joined to create modern Canada.</p>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Confederation was driven by economic needs, defense concerns, and the goal of uniting English- and French-speaking populations.</p>

                    <h3>3.1 Expanding the Dominion</h3>
                    <p>After Confederation in 1867, Canada began expanding westward and northward as new provinces and territories joined the union. Each addition brought unique resources, cultures, and challenges.</p>
                    <p>Timeline of Expansion:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1870 – Manitoba:</strong> Created after negotiations with the Métis during the Red River Resistance, led by Louis Riel. The agreement protected Métis land rights and culture.</li>
                        <li><strong>1871 – British Columbia:</strong> Joined on the promise that Canada would build a transcontinental railway within ten years.</li>
                        <li><strong>1873 – Prince Edward Island:</strong> Joined when Canada agreed to take over its railway debts and provide regular ferry service.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Canada’s borders and diversity grew gradually, often shaped by economic opportunity, transportation projects, and political agreements.</p>

                    <h3>3.2 The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)</h3>
                    <p>One of Canada’s greatest infrastructure achievements, the CPR connected the country from coast to coast:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Completed: 1885.</strong></li>
                        <li>Essential for trade, immigration settlement, and military transport.</li>
                        <li>Built largely with the labour of <strong>Chinese workers</strong>, who faced dangerous working conditions and later a discriminatory head tax.</li>
                        <li>Symbolized national unity and the ability to overcome vast geographic challenges.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>3.3 Immigration and Settlement</h3>
                    <p>Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, Canada welcomed large waves of immigrants:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prairie Provinces attracted farmers from Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and Scandinavia.</li>
                        <li>Industrial cities saw Italian, Jewish, and other European immigrants arrive for factory jobs.</li>
                        <li>Immigration from Asia and Africa was heavily restricted until reforms after World War II.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3.4 Canada in World War I (1914–1918)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Canada entered the war automatically as part of the British Empire.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>3.6 Canada in World War II (1939–1945)</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>Chapter 4 – The Government and Political System</h2>
                    <h3>4.1 Canada’s Constitutional Monarchy</h3>
                    <p>Canada is both a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Head of State:</strong> His Majesty King Charles III.</li>
                        <li><strong>Governor General:</strong> The King’s representative at the federal level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lieutenant Governors:</strong> Represent the King in each province.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The monarchy’s role is symbolic and ceremonial, while the day-to-day decisions are made by elected governments.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.2 The Federal System of Government</h3>
                    <p>Canada has three levels of government, each responsible for different areas:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Federal Government</strong> – Handles national matters such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>National defense</li>
                                <li>Foreign policy</li>
                                <li>Immigration and citizenship</li>
                                <li>Currency and banking</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Provincial/Territorial Governments</strong> – Manage:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Education</li>
                                <li>Healthcare</li>
                                <li>Natural resources</li>
                                <li>Highways</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Municipal Governments</strong> – Operate in cities, towns, and districts, handling:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Water and waste services</li>
                                <li>Local policing and fire services</li>
                                <li>Public transit</li>
                                <li>Local bylaws</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.3 Parliament</h3>
                    <p>Parliament is Canada’s legislative branch and has two chambers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>House of Commons</strong> – Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected by citizens to represent ridings (electoral districts). They introduce, debate, and vote on laws.</li>
                        <li><strong>Senate</strong> – Senators are appointed by the Governor General on the Prime Minister’s advice. They review and refine legislation passed by the House of Commons.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.4 Prime Minister and Cabinet</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prime Minister (PM):</strong> The head of government and leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cabinet Ministers:</strong> Chosen by the PM, each is responsible for a specific department (e.g., health, finance, defense). Cabinet decisions are binding on all ministers — this is called cabinet solidarity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.5 How Elections Work</h3>
                    <p>Federal elections are held at least every four years, though they can occur earlier if Parliament is dissolved.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Citizens aged 18 and older can vote in federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal elections.</li>
                        <li>Canada uses a <strong>first-past-the-post</strong> voting system: the candidate with the most votes in a riding wins, even without a majority.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>📌 Test Tip: Voting is a right and a civic duty in Canada — low voter turnout weakens democracy.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.6 Political Parties</h3>
                    <p>Political parties group people with similar political ideas and goals. At the federal level, the main parties include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Liberal Party</li>
                        <li>Conservative Party</li>
                        <li>New Democratic Party (NDP)</li>
                        <li>Bloc Québécois (operates only in Quebec)</li>
                        <li>Green Party</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Smaller parties may also run candidates but rarely form governments.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>4.7 The Role of the Public Service</h3>
                    <p>The public service is made up of non-partisan government employees who carry out the day-to-day work of running the country. They remain in their roles even when a new government is elected.</p>

                    <h3>5.1 Balancing Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>Canadian citizenship is built on a balance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rights protect your freedoms and dignity.</li>
                        <li>Responsibilities ensure Canada remains strong, fair, and democratic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These two go hand in hand — rights without responsibilities can weaken democracy, while responsibilities without rights can lead to injustice.</p>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Many rights are guaranteed under the <strong>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</strong>, part of the Constitution since 1982.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>5.2 Rights of Canadian Citizens</h3>
                    <p>While everyone in Canada enjoys certain legal protections, some rights are exclusive to citizens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Vote in Elections</strong> – At the federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Run for Public Office</strong> – Stand as a candidate in elections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hold a Canadian Passport</strong> – Travel with ease and receive Canadian diplomatic support abroad.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equality Before the Law</strong> – Protection from discrimination regardless of background.</li>
                        <li><strong>Language Rights</strong> – Access to federal government services in English or French anywhere in Canada.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>📌 Test Tip: Only citizens can vote in federal elections or hold certain government jobs requiring high-level security clearance.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>5.3 The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</h3>
                    <p>The Charter is the cornerstone of rights in Canada. It guarantees:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fundamental Freedoms</strong> – Freedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly, and association.</li>
                        <li><strong>Democratic Rights</strong> – The right to vote and run for office.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobility Rights</strong> – The right to live, work, or study anywhere in Canada and to leave or return freely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Rights</strong> – Protection from unlawful search or detention, and the right to a fair trial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equality Rights</strong> – Equal protection under the law without discrimination.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>5.4 Responsibilities of Canadian Citizens</h3>
                    <p>Rights come with obligations that help maintain Canada’s democratic system and protect the common good:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Obey the Law</strong> – The rule of law applies equally to everyone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serve on a Jury</strong> – Ensure fairness in trials when called upon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vote in Elections</strong> – Participate in shaping Canada’s future.</li>
                        <li><strong>Help Protect the Environment</strong> – Conserve resources and support sustainability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defend Canada When Needed</strong> – Contribute in times of national emergency (military service is voluntary in peacetime).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: While voting is not mandatory, low voter turnout weakens democracy.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>5.5 Why Responsibilities Matter</h3>
                    <p>A healthy democracy relies on active and informed citizens. If citizens neglect their duties — especially voting — decisions are left to fewer voices, which may not reflect the majority.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>5.6 Real-Life Examples</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Jury Duty:</strong> Serving in a criminal trial to ensure a fair verdict.</li>
                        <li><strong>Voting:</strong> Researching candidates in your riding and casting your ballot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Joining a community clean-up or supporting renewable energy projects.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Chapter 6 – Justice and the Law</h2>
                    <h3>6.1 The Rule of Law</h3>
                    <p>The foundation of Canada’s justice system is the <strong>rule of law</strong> — meaning that no one is above the law, not even the Prime Minister or other leaders.</p>
                    <p>The rule of law ensures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fairness</strong> – Everyone is treated equally in legal matters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability</strong> – Laws are applied consistently, not arbitrarily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accountability</strong> – Citizens and governments must follow the same legal rules.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Government actions can be challenged in court if they violate the Constitution or other laws.</p>

                    <h3>6.2 Sources of Canadian Law</h3>
                    <p>Canadian law comes from several traditions:</p>

                        <li><strong>English Common Law</strong> – Based on court decisions and legal precedents; applies in most of Canada.</li>
                        <li><strong>French Civil Law</strong> – Applies in Quebec for private law (contracts, property), based on written legal codes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigenous Legal Traditions</strong> – Laws and governance systems used by Indigenous peoples for centuries, increasingly recognized today.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statutory Law</strong> – Laws passed by Parliament or provincial/territorial legislatures.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Constitution</strong> – The highest law in Canada, which includes the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

                    <h3>6.3 Law Enforcement in Canada</h3>
                    <p>Canada’s police services operate at three levels:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Municipal Police</strong> – Serve cities/towns and enforce local laws.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provincial Police</strong> – Operate in provinces without municipal forces (e.g., Ontario Provincial Police, Sûreté du Québec).</li>
                        <li><strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)</strong> – The federal police force, also providing provincial policing in most provinces and territories.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>📌 Note: The RCMP’s famous red serge uniform is mainly used for ceremonies — daily policing is done in modern uniforms.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>6.4 The Court System</h3>
                    <p>Courts in Canada are independent from politics. Judges decide cases based on the law and evidence, not government orders.</p>
                    <p>Court hierarchy:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Provincial/Territorial Courts – Handle most criminal and civil cases, including family law.</li>
                        <li>Federal Courts – Deal with federal law cases (e.g., immigration, taxation).</li>
                        <li>Courts of Appeal – Review lower court decisions for legal fairness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supreme Court of Canada</strong> – The highest court; decisions are final and binding nationwide.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>📌 Test Tip: The Supreme Court has nine judges, including the Chief Justice of Canada.</p>

                    <h3>6.5 Criminal Law vs. Civil Law</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Criminal Law</strong> – Deals with offences against society (e.g., theft, assault, fraud). Punishments can include prison, fines, or community service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Civil Law</strong> – Resolves disputes between individuals or organizations (e.g., contracts, property issues). Remedies often involve payment or specific actions instead of jail.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>6.6 Citizens’ Role in Justice</h3>
                    <p>Canadians help maintain justice by:</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>6.7 Legal Aid and Access to Justice</h3>
                    <p>Canadians who cannot afford a lawyer may qualify for legal aid — a publicly funded service ensuring fair access to the legal system.</p>

                    <h3>9.1 Why Symbols Matter</h3>
                    <p>National symbols are more than decorative designs — they express a country’s history, values, and identity. In Canada, they reflect Indigenous heritage, French and British traditions, and the multicultural character of the nation today.</p>
                    <p>✔ Key Fact: Many symbols became official only after years of popular use and national recognition.</p>
                    <br>

                        <li><strong>Adopted:</strong> February 15, 1965, replacing the Red Ensign.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The maple leaf has been a Canadian emblem for over 150 years, symbolizing unity, endurance, and the natural environment.</li>
                    </ul>
