                    <h2>1. Introduction to British Columbia</h2>
                    <p>British Columbia is Canada‚Äôs westernmost province, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west, Alberta to the east, Yukon and Alaska to the north, and the U.S. states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana to the south. It is one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the country, offering everything from coastal rainforests and snow-covered mountains to arid grasslands and fertile valleys.</p>
                    <p>BC‚Äôs global reputation is built on its natural beauty, multicultural society, innovative economy, and Pacific gateway status. With Vancouver and Victoria as leading cities, British Columbia plays a vital role in Canada‚Äôs economy, immigration, and culture.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>2. First Peoples and Early Contact</h2>
                    <p>Long before Europeans arrived, Indigenous peoples thrived across BC‚Äôs lands, including the Coast Salish, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, Gitxsan, and many others. These communities developed rich oral traditions, complex societies, and sustainable economies based on fishing, cedar woodcraft, and trade networks.</p>
                    <p>European exploration began in the late 1700s, notably by Captain James Cook (1778) and George Vancouver (1792). Early European traders and settlers disrupted traditional ways of life, bringing diseases and forcing relocation, though Indigenous culture remains strong today.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>3. Confederation and Provincehood</h2>
                    <p>Unlike the original four provinces that formed Confederation in 1867, BC joined later‚Äîin 1871‚Äîafter negotiating a commitment from the federal government to build a transcontinental railway. This commitment resulted in the Canadian Pacific Railway reaching BC by 1885, symbolically uniting the country ‚Äúfrom sea to sea.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>This development allowed for increased immigration and expansion, leading to the growth of key cities and industries.</p>
                    <br>
